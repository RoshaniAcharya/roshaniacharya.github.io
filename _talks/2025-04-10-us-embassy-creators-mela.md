I was a part of a panel discussion at the US Embassy Creator’s Mela 2025 in Pokhara. The session, titled "AI for the Next Gen – Unlocking Digital Tools for Creative & Responsible Innovation," featured insightful conversations about AI alongside fellow speakers Aayush Kasajoo and Ashwin Neupane. The session was moderated by Avinash Kundaliya. 

The enthusiasm shown by the youth towards AI was truly inspiring. I would like to extend our gratitude to the US Embassy Nepal for the invitation. I was thrilled to be a part of Creator’s Mela 2025 in Pokhara.
